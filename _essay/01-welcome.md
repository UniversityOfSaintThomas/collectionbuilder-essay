**Let's all stop writing digital scholarship pieces in Microsoft Word.** And let's start encouraging students writing for digital projects to do the same.

I know it's hard. So many times, during the 10+ years I've been doing this, I've given up at the end of a project and allowed this to happen, capitulating to the dominant, overwrought writing technology of our time in order to *make it easy*{% include essay/feature/aside.html text="As my colleague Evan notes: Word is not easy! It's incredibly complicated!" %} on myself and the faculty or students we work with.  

And this is not to cast aspersions on them or myself: learning new technologies takes time, and time is short, especially during a semester. 

I think it's time we stopped giving in tho. And in order to make that easier, we made a tool that helps users to truly ***write with, on, and for*** the web.{% include essay/feature/aside.html text="Note: And if you really need the WSIWYG, use Google Docs then download in Markdown!" %}

This and the following mini-essays will serve as an introduction and starter documentation. 

## So What Is It?

***CB-Essay*** is a Jekyll-based framework that combines **long-form essay writing** with **digital collection features**. Built on [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), it enables you to create multimodal scholarly narratives, written in Markdown, that integrate primary sources, archival materials, and multimedia items directly into your texts.

## What Makes CB-Essay Different?

Traditional digital publishing tools treat essays and collections as separate entities. CB-Essay connects them, allowing you to:

- **Reference collection items** using simple includes
- Create **asides and margin notes** that link to primary sources {% include /essay/feature/aside.html text="Like this!" %}
- Build **interactive visualizations** from your metadata that help contextualize your work
- **Publish your work for free** on GitHub 
- Fashion the readers' experience through **scroll-based interactions and custom typography/fonts** {% include /essay/feature/aside.html text="Keep scrolling to see the next section magically appear!" %}"

{% include essay/new-section.html %}

## How It Works

CB-Essay operates on a **dual-collection model**:

1. **Essay Collection** - Your narrative content lives in `_essay/` as Markdown files
2. **Object Collection** - Primary sources and items defined in a CSV metadata file

CB-Essay allows you to write ***with*** your collection of sources, allowing you to integrate references, images, documents, recordings, and videos seamlessly into your writing and into the web. 

Just follow the plan as in the below image.
